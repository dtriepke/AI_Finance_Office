    "Processing invoices is a time-consuming task for many businesses, and it can be prone to errors such as duplicate payments or incomplete data. Machine learning can automate the processing of invoices by extracting data from invoices, verifying the information, and matching it with purchase orders and contracts. This can significantly reduce the time required for invoice processing and free up staff to focus on more high-value tasks.\n",

      "5. Additional Details: The report should include a section for additional details such as payment terms and currency if applicable. If these details are not available, the report should note that they were not provided and suggest obtaining them for complete verification.\n",

      "6. Report Format: The report should be formatted with clear headings and bullet points for better readability. Each section should be distinctly separated.\n",
