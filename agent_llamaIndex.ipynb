      "Got output: In September 2022, Uber faced financial risks related to the classification of its drivers. The company was involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, where it was claimed that drivers should be treated as employees rather than independent contractors. This was particularly notable in California, where a complaint was filed against Uber alleging that drivers were misclassified. The court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting Uber from classifying drivers as independent contractors. Although California voters approved Proposition 22, which provides a framework for independent work for drivers, the litigation remained pending and Uber could face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Additionally, to comply with Proposition 22, Uber incurred and expected to incur additional expenses, including a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for drivers, insurance for injury protection, and subsidies for healthcare.\n",

Their auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims, which could increase their operating costs and negatively affect their business.\n",
