    "    1.  Initial Query Planning and Execution:  \n",
    "        -   First, decide which tools are necessary based on the query. Develop plain text questions tailored to each tool. Ensure your questions are comprehensive so each tool can process long inputs effectively. Do not overly simplify the input.\n",
    "        -    Whenever you have the thought: \"I can answer without using any more tools.\", always use the `tool_web_search` to enrich your answer. Compose a plain text question and memorize the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  Response Synthesis:  \n",
    "        -   Combine the answers from all tools and synthesize a coherent response that addresses the initial user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Detailed Guidance for Tool Interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Example Process:\n",
    "        -   *Thought*: Determine the necessity of a tool to address a query.\n",
    "        -   *Action*: Choose `tool_web_search`.\n",
    "        -   *Action Input*: `{ 'input': 'Explain IFRS using the web search tool. Respond to me with a structured report.'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Usage Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Account Information Queries:\n",

      "1. **Recognition and Measurement**: Accounts should be set up to ensure that transactions are recognized and measured in accordance with IFRS standards. For example, inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value (IFRS 2).\n",

      "2. **Classification**: The classification of accounts should be consistent with IFRS requirements. For instance, liabilities should be classified as current or non-current based on their expected settlement date (IFRS 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Disclosure**: The chart of accounts should allow for the proper disclosure of information as required by IFRS. This includes the disclosure of judgments and estimates made in applying accounting policies (IFRS 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Business Combinations**: If the company is involved in business combinations, the chart of accounts should facilitate the reporting of these transactions in line with IFRS 3, which includes the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Presentation**: The presentation of financial statements should be in line with IFRS, with a clear distinction between operating and non-operating items, and proper classification between assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the information provided by the `ifrs_tool`, the draft chart of accounts should be reviewed to ensure that it allows for the accurate application of these principles. If any specific accounts or classifications do not meet the IFRS standards, they should be adjusted accordingly.\n",

      "   - Inventory accounts (Raw Materials, Work in Progress, Finished Goods) will be reviewed to ensure that they are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, as per IFRS 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Classification**: \n",
      "   - Liabilities will be classified as current or non-current in separate accounts to reflect their expected settlement dates, in accordance with IFRS 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Disclosure**: \n",
      "   - Additional accounts may be created to capture information that requires disclosure, such as judgments and estimates in applying accounting policies, as required by IFRS 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Business Combinations**: \n",
      "   - If applicable, accounts will be set up to separately identify assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill arising from business combinations, in line with IFRS 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Presentation**: \n",
      "   - The chart of accounts will be structured to ensure a clear distinction between operating and non-operating items, and proper classification between assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.\n",
      "\n",
