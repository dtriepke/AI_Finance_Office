      "\n",
      "3. **Check for Silent Exceptions**: It's possible that exceptions are being raised but not printed. You can add a print statement in the `except` block of the `main` function to ensure that any caught exceptions are visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Manual Invocation**: Try to manually invoke the `main` function within the script with a hardcoded URL to see if it works as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Environment Check**: Ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that all necessary libraries (like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) are installed and can be imported without issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Command-Line Syntax**: Double-check the command-line syntax you're using to run the script. Ensure that you're in the correct directory and that the script is being called with the correct Python interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're still unable to get the script to produce output, you might need to seek assistance from someone who can access your environment and provide direct help. Unfortunately, without the ability to receive more detailed feedback or directly interact with your environment, there's a limit to how much I can assist remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please try the troubleshooting steps mentioned above, and if you're still facing issues, consider reaching out to a colleague or a professional who can provide hands-on assistance.\n",

You can add a print statement in the `except` block of the `main` function to ensure that any caught exceptions are visible.\\n\\n4. **Manual Invocation**: Try to manually invoke the `main` function within the script with a hardcoded URL to see if it works as expected.\\n\\n5. **Environment Check**: Ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that all necessary libraries (like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) are installed and can be imported without issues.\\n\\n6. **Command-Line Syntax**: Double-check the command-line syntax you\\'re using to run the script. Ensure that you\\'re in the correct directory and that the script is being called with the correct Python interpreter.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still unable to get the script to produce output, you might need to seek assistance from someone who can access your environment and provide direct help. Unfortunately, without the ability to receive more detailed feedback or directly interact with your environment, there\\'s a limit to how much I can assist remotely.\\n\\nPlease try the troubleshooting steps mentioned above, and if you\\'re still facing issues, consider reaching out to a colleague or a professional who can provide hands-on assistance.']\n"

       " 'It seems that the script is still not producing any output despite executing successfully. This persistent issue suggests that there might be a deeper problem with the script or the environment in which it is being run.\\n\\nAt this point, without further information or the ability to interact with your environment directly, it\\'s challenging to diagnose the issue further. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:\\n\\n1. **Check the Script Manually**: Open the `summarize_article.py` script in a text editor and ensure that the code I provided has been correctly copied and saved. Look for any syntax errors or missing parts.\\n\\n2. **Run a Simple Print Test**: Before the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line, add a simple print statement like `print(\"Script is running\")` and run the script again to see if this output is displayed.\\n\\n3. **Check for Silent Exceptions**: It\\'s possible that exceptions are being raised but not printed. You can add a print statement in the `except` block of the `main` function to ensure that any caught exceptions are visible.\\n\\n4. **Manual Invocation**: Try to manually invoke the `main` function within the script with a hardcoded URL to see if it works as expected.\\n\\n5. **Environment Check**: Ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that all necessary libraries (like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) are installed and can be imported without issues.\\n\\n6. **Command-Line Syntax**: Double-check the command-line syntax you\\'re using to run the script. Ensure that you\\'re in the correct directory and that the script is being called with the correct Python interpreter.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still unable to get the script to produce output, you might need to seek assistance from someone who can access your environment and provide direct help. Unfortunately, without the ability to receive more detailed feedback or directly interact with your environment, there\\'s a limit to how much I can assist remotely.\\n\\nPlease try the troubleshooting steps mentioned above, and if you\\'re still facing issues, consider reaching out to a colleague or a professional who can provide hands-on assistance.']"
