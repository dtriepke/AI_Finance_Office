    "AI in Back Office and Invoice Processing\n",
    "Processing invoices is a time-consuming task for many businesses, and it can be prone to errors such as duplicate payments or incomplete data. Machine learning can automate the processing of invoices by extracting data from invoices, verifying the information, and matching it with purchase orders and contracts. This can significantly reduce the time required for invoice processing and free up staff to focus on more high-value tasks.\n",

      "- **Date Discrepancy:** The invoice date (09/18/2015) and the purchase order date (09/15/2022) do not align, indicating a potential issue.\n",
      "- **Creditor Name:** Matches between the invoice and the purchase order (Castro PLC).\n",
      "- **Description Discrepancy:** The goods/services described in the invoice do not match the purchase order. The invoice describes a \"12\" Marble Lapis Inlay Chess Table Top With 2\" Pieces & 15\" Wooden Stand W537,\" while the purchase order describes \"Supply of office furniture.\"\n",
      "- **Line Item Discrepancy:** The line items in the invoice do not match those in the purchase order. The invoice lists a single item, while the purchase order lists multiple items (Office Chair and Desk).\n",
      "- **Net Amount Discrepancy:** The invoice net amount ($889.2) does not match the purchase order net amount ($5000.0).\n",
      "- **Gross Amount Discrepancy:** The invoice gross amount ($978.12) does not match the purchase order gross amount ($5500.0).\n",
      "- **Tax Amount Discrepancy:** The invoice tax amount ($88.92) does not match the purchase order tax amount ($500.0).\n",
      "- **Discounts:** No discounts are mentioned in either the invoice or the purchase order.\n",
      "- **Purchase Order Number:** Missing from the invoice; the corresponding number is PO123456.\n",
      "- **Payment Terms:** Not specified in the invoice; the purchase order specifies \"Net 30 days.\"\n",
      "- **Currency:** Not mentioned in the invoice; the purchase order specifies USD.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Red Flags:\n",
      "- **Date Mismatch:** The invoice date is significantly earlier than the purchase order date.\n",
      "- **Description Mismatch:** The goods/services described in the invoice do not match those in the purchase order.\n",
      "- **Amount Mismatch:** Significant discrepancies in net amount, gross amount, and tax amount.\n",
      "- **Missing Purchase Order Number:** The invoice does not include the purchase order number.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Check Calculations:\n",
      "- **Unit Price and Quantity:** The unit price ($444.6) and quantity (2) on the invoice correctly calculate to the total price ($889.2).\n",
      "- **Tax Calculation:** The tax amount ($88.92) appears to be correctly calculated based on the net amount ($889.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Bank Account Balance Coverage:\n",
      "- **Current Balance:** $200.0\n",
      "- **Invoice Net Amount:** $889.2\n",
      "- **Coverage:** The current bank account balance is insufficient to cover the invoice net amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "- **Contact Castro PLC:** Address the significant discrepancies in dates, descriptions, and amounts.\n",
      "- **Review Internal Controls:** Ensure purchase order numbers are included on all invoices and that descriptions and amounts match.\n",
      "- **Assess Financial Position:** Take necessary actions to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover upcoming invoices.\n",

      "- Description of Goods or Service: 12\" Marble Lapis Inlay Chess Table Top With 2\" Pieces & 15\" Wooden Stand W537\n",
      "- Overall Status: yellow\n",
      "- Likelihood of fraud:\n",
      "    - Score: 30% risk\n",
      "    - Reasoning: The tax amount on the invoice does not match the expected tax amount from the purchase order, and the purchase order number is missing from the invoice. These discrepancies could indicate a potential issue with the invoice's validity.\n",
      "- Bank Account Balance Coverage: No, the current bank account balance is $200, which is below the invoice net amount total of $889.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Flags:\n",
      "- Tax Amounts: The invoice specifies a tax amount of $88.92, whereas the purchase order indicates a tax amount of $10.00. This significant discrepancy needs to be resolved.\n",
      "- Purchase Order Number: The invoice does not reference a purchase order number, which is typically required for matching and verification purposes. The corresponding purchase order number is 333333.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check Calculations:\n",
      "- Line Item Net Amount: Matches the purchase order (2 units at $444.6 each, total $889.2).\n",
      "- Total Net Amount: Matches the purchase order ($889.2).\n",
      "- Gross Amount: Matches the purchase order ($978.12).\n",
      "- Line Item Amount: The invoice line item amount matches the purchase order line item amount ($889.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "All other calculations on the invoice, including unit prices and quantities, are accurate and match the purchase order details. However, the discrepancy in the tax amount and the missing purchase order number on the invoice are areas of concern that should be addressed. Additionally, the current bank account balance is insufficient to cover the invoice amount, which could lead to payment issues.\n",

      "The report form is well-structured and includes essential details for invoice verification. However, there are a few areas that need to be addressed to ensure the report's quality and efficiency:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Invoice Date and Purchase Order Date**: The report should mention the dates of both the invoice and the purchase order to confirm they align and are within acceptable terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Payment Terms**: If available, the report should include payment terms from both the invoice and the purchase order to ensure they match and to determine the payment due date.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Currency**: The currency should be specified to avoid any confusion, especially if the company operates internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Bank Account Balance Date**: The report should mention the date of the bank account balance to provide context for the financial status.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Likelihood of Fraud**: The report should clarify how the 30% risk score was determined. Is there a specific methodology or set of criteria used to assess the risk of fraud?\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Action Items**: The report should suggest next steps or action items, such as contacting the creditor to resolve discrepancies or reviewing internal controls to prevent future mismatches.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Formatting**: Ensure that the report is formatted consistently. For example, \"2 unite\" in the purchase order line item description should be corrected to \"2 units.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Summary of Findings**: It would be beneficial to have a concise summary of findings at the beginning of the report for quick reference.\n",
      "\n",
